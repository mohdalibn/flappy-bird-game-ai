This is a **Python** project featuring a replica of the **Flappy Bird** game with images sprites found online using a python game library called **PyGame**. The **Neural Network Model** was developed using a special **genetic algorithm** module in python called the **Neural Evolution of Augmented Topologies (NEAT)**  .The design of the mainmenu background, the navigation buttons, and the statistics dashboards were all created using a design prototyping tool called **Figma**. In this application, the user is able to **Train** & **Test** thier model which is stored as a **pickle file** under the name **BestBirdNN**.

- Click on the green **Code** button on the top of this page and download the repository zip using the method of your choice.
- Extract the files into a suitable folder.
- Open the mainmenu.py file on the IDE of your choice. (VSCode Recommended)
- The repository already comes with a trained **BestBirdNN** model. To train your own model, delete the **BestBirdNN file** first and then run the mainmenu.py file and click on the **Train** button on the main menu. Once the **training** process is complete, a new **BestBirdNN** file will be created.
- Click on the **Test** button on the main menu to test your model.
